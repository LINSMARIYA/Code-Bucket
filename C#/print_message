//The first technique used Console.WriteLine() to print an entire message to the output console. 
//At the end of the line, it added a line feed similar to how you might use the Enter or Return key on your keyboard to create a new line of text.

//The second technique used Console.Write() to print to the output console, but at the end, it doesn't add a line feed. 
//So, the next call to Console.Write() prints an additional message to the same line.
